# Tic-Tac-Toe
A simple and interactive Tic Tac Toe game developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project allows two players to take turns marking ‚ÄúX‚Äù and ‚ÄúO‚Äù on a 3x3 grid, with automatic detection of wins, draws, and support for resetting/restarting the game.
# Features

Two-player mode: Play alternately as "X" or "O".

Win & draw detection: Highlights winning combinations and announces draws when the board fills up.

UI feedback: Colors and backgrounds update dynamically based on the current player.

Responsive design: Works well on desktop and mobile screens.

Reset and Restart buttons: Quickly clear the board or begin a new match after declaring a winner.

# üéÆHow to Play

Click any cell on the board to make your move.

The game will automatically switch turns and announce whose turn it is.

When a player gets three marks in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally), the game highlights the winning cells and declares the winner.

If all cells are filled with no winner, the game announces a draw.

Use "Reset Game" to clear the board at any time or "Restart Game" after a win to play again.
